linear Regression Model to Given Dataset (Car Data.csv) and Make The Predictions With and Without Removing The OUTLIERS By Comparing All the Performance Metrics (Same for Multiple Linear Regression Model)


Overview
This project involves building a linear regression model to predict car prices based on various features. The dataset used is Car Data.csv, and the model's performance is evaluated both with and without removing outliers.
